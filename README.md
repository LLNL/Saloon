# Saloon

Saloon is the Vim plugin that eases Python code linter / fixer configuration all from the comfort of a side bar.

Saloon's menu lets developers toggle which static analysis tools to use and delegates those changes to [ALE's](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) API.
Since [prospector](http://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/) already handles multiple tools, and knows what to do with ALE, most of the actual linting will be done through prospector calls.

## Installation
